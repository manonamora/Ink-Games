    "is this project dead? like tell us so we dont have to wait" for nothing
    ** [Snarky Response]
        Yes, of course, it has to be dead, because I never mention wanting to get back to it, and have stopped making any progress, and removed any content regarding the game.
            Do you even read my logs, Anon?
        *** [Post Answer]
            That'll shut them up.

            Not worth it.

    ** [Sincere Response]
        No, Anon. It's not dead. I am trying to hard to work on this, but I've honestly been struggling a lot with it. I love the characters and the setting, and there's a lot I want to explore. But I... I just can't make progress on it. I keep trying, again and again, and still...
        It's blank page all the way down. And I feel bad for all of you following, but it's just... I'm sorry for disappointing everyone.
        *** [Post Answer]
            They'll think I'm making excuses again. And someone else will give me grief for it...

        Like I even had the chance to begin with! Didn't you see how stacked it was? Really outstanding games by amazing authors! They totally deserved it, don't you think?
